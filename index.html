 Dear members of the open source community, dear developers,

We gather here today to witness a new chapter in the open source movement. First, let me express, on behalf of the Wukong Software team, our heartfelt gratitude to every user and developer who has continuously supported our growth.

Over the past 9 years, with the help of many friends, Wukong CRM has grown into a leading open source CRM system in China. Looking ahead, we believe we should open source even more - ERP, HRM, no-code, financial management, and more. We are thankful for the valuable opportunities given to us by our peers, which have allowed us to continuously move forward on the open source path. When every feature of the software improves and every bug gets fixed, we see not just technological progress, but the spirit of open source collaboration and support shining through.

The prevalence of open source software today stems from the open, collaborative spirit it embodies. Without a foundation of mutual trust and the sparks of ideological exchange, open source could not have thrived. It is in this inclusive, open culture that every developer can feel the joy of being supported and giving back. This positive, open way of working is a precious asset that no closed, commercial software can possess.

Of course, there are also many difficulties on the open source path. Lack of resource support often makes our steps falter, but we know that as long as we stay true to the open source ideal, the power of collaboration will ultimately help us overcome challenges. When contemplating business models causes us to stumble along the way, we remind ourselves that sticking to our ideals is the only way to light the path forward again. As pioneers in the open source world, we often ask ourselves - should we continue on this long journey? And each time, the answer is an unhesitating yes.

Dear friends, at this moment, let us re-examine the original ideals of open source - the passionate pursuit of knowledge and technological progress, the adherence to openness and collaboration! Such ideals have already changed the ecology of the entire software world, and we must not let them fade halfway! Wukong will continue to vigorously promote this culture and expand more beneficial open source projects. We sincerely hope to join hands with more like-minded friends, and continue to advance the open source movement.

Finally, let us cheer again for the open source culture! Let us continue to bravely strive for our dreams and ideals! With your support and companionship on this long march, we firmly believe everything is possible! We will continue to uphold the spirit of open source and create greater shared value for society. Thank you again everyone! Let us continue hand in hand and usher in a bright future!
